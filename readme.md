# Sift&amp;Sort Table

Sift&amp;Sort is a table plugin that provides the following functionality: Searching, Sorting, Adding a Record, Editing a Record and Deleting a Record.

**This is currently a work in progress (WIP).**

#### Roadmap Future:

+ Possibly integrate HTML5 LocalStorage
+ Possibly integrate js database (taffydb, mongodb or couchdb)
+ Add Several Theme options
+ Possibly fully integrate Zurb Foundation 4/5

#### How it was Created:

+ [rmm5t / jquery-sieve][1] - Search Table Instantly
+ [tristen / tablesort][2] - Add Sorting Ability By Row / Column
+ [javve / list][3] - Add / Edit / Delete
+ [zurb / reveal][4] - Slick Modals
